## PROJECT OVERVIEW ##
 In this project, I am going to create an application that creates, edits , updates and delete tasks.

## FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY ##
The system functions by adding tasks,
the task title, description and the due date. It allows for the editing of the task, deletion of the task and marking the task completed by clicking of the checkbox.
These tasks are saved to local storage.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED ##
 HTML- forms and front end rendering
 CSS - styling
 JAVASCRIPT - to handle the client-side processing and local storage
